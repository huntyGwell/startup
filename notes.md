#Notes on what I learn throughout this project#

# startup

StartUp260 is a practical and engaging course where I get to create my own website

## github assignment
 - I am excited to get started and make some mistakes!
    - I pushed and pulled but there seems to be a lag for some reason.
    - 'oh well'
      - not just 'oh well' I fixed it.
people sometimes say:

>it will all work out.

I dont think so. *Unless* you **work** to *make* it work out.


## HTML 
 - I am learning the basics of HTML and one fun thing I learned is how to include images.
   - It is much easier to download the image.
