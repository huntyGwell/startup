# startup
StartUp260 is a practical and engaging course where I get to create my own website
 - I am excited to get started and make some mistakes!
    - I pushed and pulled but there seems to be a lag for some reason.
    - 'oh well'
      - not just 'oh well' I fixed it.
people sometimes say:
>it will all work out.
I dont think so. *Unless* you **work** to *make* it okay
