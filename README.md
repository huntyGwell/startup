# startup

StartUp260 is a practical and engaging course where I get to create my own website

## github assignment
 - I am excited to get started and make some mistakes!
    - I pushed and pulled but there seems to be a lag for some reason.
    - 'oh well'
      - not just 'oh well' I fixed it.
people sometimes say:

>it will all work out.

I dont think so. *Unless* you **work** to *make* it okay


## Elavator Pitch
>Have you ever struggled to stay consistant with a workout/ training regimen?
>It is a constant struggle for me. When I finally do have the time to work out it can be difficult to tell if I am making any progress towards my goals.
>That is why I am creating this fitness tracking web application.
>In order to make progress on anything there muse be some sort of tracking and accountablillity.

This app will aid in motivation as well as being an aid to tracking progress by:
1. Allowing you to track your progress over time.
2. Allowing you to get a social support system involved in your fitness joureny 
3. Showing you how consistent you have been on your fitness journey. (nobody is perfect but this is a tool that can be helpful)
